<meta name="description" content="“Managing a project effectively means thinking before acting[…].” (Portny &amp; Austin 2002)  A note on project management Creativity in research and project management are not incompatible. In fact, most if not all research requires the definition of some kind of aim or the organization of tasks in time schedules. Project requirements that define tasks might not be developed or even known at some stage of the project but project management is not a stiff corset.  Common project management steps are:    Define the project and its goals,   Break down the project into tasks and define a schedule,   Design workflows for each task and implement them,   Adjust your tasks, solve problems and be flexible.   While many project management solutions are available, the GitHub project board feature might be all you ever need at least during your course of study.

<p>Creativity in research and project management are not incompatible. In fact, most if not all research requires the definition of some kind of aim or the organization of tasks in time schedules. Project requirements that define tasks might not be developed or even known at some stage of the project but project management is not a stiff corset.</p>

<p>Common project management steps are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Define the project and its goals,</li>
  <li>Break down the project into tasks and define a schedule,</li>
  <li>Design workflows for each task and implement them,</li>
  <li>Adjust your tasks, solve problems and be flexible.</li>
</ul>

<p>While many project management solutions are available, the GitHub project board feature might be all you ever need at least during your course of study.</p>
