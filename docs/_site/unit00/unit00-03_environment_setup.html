<meta name="description" content="We value freedom of choice as an important good but giving our long-term experience freedom of choice comes to an end when we talk about the mandatory working environment for this course. The reason for this is simple: you work with assignments and a piece of code written on the laptop of person A should run basically without any changes on the computer of person B. The situation gets nastier if you should test some code of a peer or if the instructors would like to run your script on their own system. Hence, let’s save everybody’s time and focus on the things which are really important. Once the course is finished, feel free to use any working environment structure you like.  Setup of the environment in R  Setting up a working or project environment usually requires the definition and creation of different folder paths, the loading of necessary R packages and additional functions that are “always” needed. If additional software like GIS should also be accessible, respective binaries and software environments must be linked, too. Setting up a working or project environment requires the definition of different folder paths and the loading of necessary R packages and additional functions. If additional software like GIS should also be accessible, respective binaries and software environments must be linked, too.  For setting up a project environment, one can use a set-up script and the envimaR package.  Coping with different absolute paths across different computers The biggest problem when it comes to cross-computer project path environments is not the project environment itself, i.e. the subfolders of your project relative to your project folder but the absolute path to your project folder. Imagine you agreed on a project folder called mpg-envinsys-plygrnd. On the laptop of person A, the absolute path to the root folder might be C:\Users\UserA\University\mpg-envinsys-plygrnd while on the external hard disk of person B it might be X:\university_courses\mpg-envinsys-plygrnd. If you want to read from your data subfolder you have to change the absolute directory path depending on which computer the script is running. Not good.  One solution to this problem is to agree on a common structure relative to your individual R home directory using symbolic links (Linux flavor systems) or junctions (Windows flavor systems).  Example: Create a top-level folder name which hosts all of your student projects. For example, this folder is called edu. Within edu, the project folder of this course is called mpg-envinsys-plygrnd. Create the folder edu anywhere you want, e.g. at D:\stuff\important\edu. Then create a so called symbolic link to this folder within your R home directory i.e. the directory where path.expand(&quot;~&quot;) points to.  To create this link on Windows flavor systems, start a command prompt window (e.g. press [Windows], type “CMD”, press [Return]) and change the directory of the command prompt window to your R home directory which is C:\Users\your-user-name\Documents by default. Then use the mklink \J command to create the symbolic link. In summary and given the paths above:  cd C:\Users\your-user-name\Documents mklink /J edu D:\stuff\important\edu   On Linux flavor systems, the R home directory is your home directory by default, i.e. /home/your-user-name/. If you create your edu folder on /media/memory/interesting/edu, the symbolic link can be created using your bash environment: cd /home/&lt;your-user-name&gt;/ ln -s /media/memory/interesting/edu edu  Now one can access the edu folder on both the windows and the Linux example via the home directory, i.e. ~/edu/. All problems solved.  While this will work on all of your private computers, it will not work on the ones in the University’s computer lab. To handle that as smooth as possible, you can use the functionality of the envimaR package which allows to set defaults for all computers but one special type which is handled differently.  Basic workflow of the setup procedure  There are two aspects we would draw your attention to:    Define everything once not twice: It is a good idea to define your project folder structure, the required libraries and other settings in one place. A simple approach would be a setup script, i.e. something like 000_setup.R that is sourced into each control or analysis script of your project.   Use the same project folder structure in a team: Use the same folder structure relative to a fixed starting point across all computers and devices of your team. As a starting point, a folder in your home directory  (e.g. ~/edu) is a good choice. Within this folder you can directly store your projects or use a symlink to any other place on your storage devices. 1   Special considerations at our computer labs The R home directory on the computers in the labs at Marburg University points to the network drive H:/Documents. For storage space reasons, you could not use this drive for symlinks. Therefore, you have to define an alternative starting point for your project folders to work with.  To handle your project relative on all computers using something beneath your  home directory ~ as a starting point except on one type of computer (i.e. the ones in the University computer labs), we recommend to use the functionality of the envimaR package.  Preliminary consideration Again f the course we assume that    your local starting point is ~/edu,   your project is called mpg-envinsys-plygrnd,   your git repository is called name_of_github_team_repository,   your setup script is called 000_setup.R and is located at name_of_github_team_repository/src.   Please install the envimaR package from GitHub.  devtools::install_github(&quot;envima/envimaR&quot;)   Template for setup script  First of all copy and paste the following code in a file named 000_setup.R.

    <meta itemprop="description" content="We value freedom of choice as an important good but giving our long-term experience freedom of choice comes to an end when we talk about the mandatory working environment for this course. The reason for this is simple: you work with assignments and a piece of code written on the laptop of person A should run basically without any changes on the computer of person B. The situation gets nastier if you should test some code of a peer or if the instructors would like to run your script on their own system. Hence, let’s save everybody’s time and focus on the things which are really important. Once the course is finished, feel free to use any working environment structure you like.Setup of the environment in RSetting up a working or project environment usually requires the definition and creation of different folder paths, the loading of necessary R packages and additional functions that are “always” needed. If additional software like GIS should also be accessible, respective binaries and software environments must be linked, too.Setting up a working or project environment requires the definition of different folder paths and the loading of necessary R packages and additional functions. If additional software like GIS should also be accessible, respective binaries and software environments must be linked, too.For setting up a project environment, one can use a set-up script and the envimaR package.Coping with different absolute paths across different computersThe biggest problem when it comes to cross-computer project path environments is not the project environment itself, i.e. the subfolders of your project relative to your project folder but the absolute path to your project folder. Imagine you agreed on a project folder called mpg-envinsys-plygrnd. On the laptop of person A, the absolute path to the root folder might be C:\Users\UserA\University\mpg-envinsys-plygrnd while on the external hard disk of person B it might be X:\university_courses\mpg-envinsys-plygrnd. If you want to read from your data subfolder you have to change the absolute directory path depending on which computer the script is running. Not good.One solution to this problem is to agree on a common structure relative to your individual R home directory using symbolic links (Linux flavor systems) or junctions (Windows flavor systems).Example: Create a top-level folder name which hosts all of your student projects. For example, this folder is called edu. Within edu, the project folder of this course is called mpg-envinsys-plygrnd. Create the folder edu anywhere you want, e.g. at D:\stuff\important\edu. Then create a so called symbolic link to this folder within your R home directory i.e. the directory where path.expand(&quot;~&quot;) points to.To create this link on Windows flavor systems, start a command prompt window (e.g. press [Windows], type “CMD”, press [Return]) and change the directory of the command prompt window to your R home directory which is C:\Users\your-user-name\Documents by default. Then use the mklink \J command to create the symbolic link. In summary and given the paths above:cd C:\Users\your-user-name\Documentsmklink /J edu D:\stuff\important\eduOn Linux flavor systems, the R home directory is your home directory by default, i.e. /home/your-user-name/. If you create your edu folder on /media/memory/interesting/edu, the symbolic link can be created using your bash environment:cd /home/&lt;your-user-name&gt;/ln -s /media/memory/interesting/edu eduNow one can access the edu folder on both the windows and the Linux example via the home directory, i.e. ~/edu/. All problems solved.While this will work on all of your private computers, it will not work on the ones in the University’s computer lab. To handle that as smooth as possible, you can use the functionality of the envimaR package which allows to set defaults for all computers but one special type which is handled differently.Basic workflow of the setup procedureThere are two aspects we would draw your attention to:  Define everything once not twice: It is a good idea to define your projectfolder structure, the required libraries and other settings in one place. A simpleapproach would be a setup script, i.e. something like 000_setup.R that is sourcedinto each control or analysis script of your project.  Use the same project folder structure in a team: Use the same folder structurerelative to a fixed starting point across all computers and devices of your team.As a starting point, a folder in your home directory  (e.g. ~/edu) is a good choice.Within this folder you can directly store your projects or use a symlink to anyother place on your storage devices. 1Special considerations at our computer labsThe R home directory on the computers in the labs at Marburg University points tothe network drive H:/Documents. For storage space reasons, you could not usethis drive for symlinks. Therefore, you have to define an alternative starting pointfor your project folders to work with.To handle your project relative on all computers using something beneath your home directory ~ as a starting point except on one type of computer (i.e. theones in the University computer labs), we recommend to use the functionality ofthe envimaR package.Preliminary considerationAgain f the course we assume that  your local starting point is ~/edu,  your project is called mpg-envinsys-plygrnd,  your git repository is called name_of_github_team_repository,  your setup script is called 000_setup.R and is located at name_of_github_team_repository/src.Please install the envimaR package from GitHub.devtools::install_github(&quot;envima/envimaR&quot;)Template for setup scriptFirst of all copy and paste the following code in a file named 000_setup.R.

        <p>We value freedom of choice as an important good but giving our long-term experience freedom of choice comes to an end when we talk about the mandatory working environment for this course. The reason for this is simple: you work with assignments and a piece of code written on the laptop of person A should run basically without any changes on the computer of person B. The situation gets nastier if you should test some code of a peer or if the instructors would like to run your script on their own system. Hence, let’s save everybody’s time and focus on the things which are really important. Once the course is finished, feel free to use any working environment structure you like.</p>

<h2 id="setup-of-the-environment-in-r">Setup of the environment in R</h2>

<p>Setting up a working or project environment usually requires the definition and creation of different folder paths, the loading of necessary R packages and additional functions that are “always” needed. If additional software like GIS should also be accessible, respective binaries and software environments must be linked, too.
Setting up a working or project environment requires the definition of different folder paths and the loading of necessary R packages and additional functions. If additional software like GIS should also be accessible, respective binaries and software environments must be linked, too.</p>

<p>For setting up a project environment, one can use a set-up script and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">envimaR</code> package.</p>

<h2 id="coping-with-different-absolute-paths-across-different-computers">Coping with different absolute paths across different computers</h2>
<p>The biggest problem when it comes to cross-computer project path environments is not the project environment itself, i.e. the subfolders of your project <em>relative</em> to your project folder but the <em>absolute</em> path to your project folder. Imagine you agreed on a project folder called mpg-envinsys-plygrnd. On the laptop of person A, the absolute path to the root folder might be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C:\Users\UserA\University\mpg-envinsys-plygrnd</code> while on the external hard disk of person B it might be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X:\university_courses\mpg-envinsys-plygrnd</code>. If you want to read from your data subfolder you have to change the absolute directory path depending on which computer the script is running. Not good.</p>

<p class="notice--success">One solution to this problem is to agree on a common structure <em>relative</em> to your individual R home directory using symbolic links (Linux flavor systems) or junctions (Windows flavor systems).</p>

<p>Example: Create a top-level folder name which hosts all of your student projects. For example, this folder is called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">edu</code>. Within <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">edu</code>, the project folder of this course is called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mpg-envinsys-plygrnd</code>. Create the folder <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">edu</code> anywhere you want, e.g. at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">D:\stuff\important\edu</code>. Then create a so called symbolic link to this folder within your R home directory i.e. the directory where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">path.expand("~")</code> points to.</p>

<p>To create this link on Windows flavor systems, start a command prompt window (e.g. press [Windows], type “CMD”, press [Return]) and change the directory of the command prompt window to your R home directory which is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C:\Users\your-user-name\Documents</code> by default. Then use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mklink \J</code> command to create the symbolic link. In summary and given the paths above:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="s">cd C:\Users\your-user-name\Documents</span>
<span class="s">mklink /J edu D:\stuff\important\edu</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>On Linux flavor systems, the R home directory is your home directory by default, i.e. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/home/your-user-name/</code>. If you create your edu folder on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/media/memory/interesting/edu</code>, the symbolic link can be created using your bash environment:</p>
<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="s">cd /home/&lt;your-user-name&gt;/</span>
<span class="s">ln -s /media/memory/interesting/edu edu</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Now one can access the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">edu</code> folder on both the windows and the Linux example via the home directory, i.e. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/edu/</code>. All problems solved.</p>

<p class="notice--info">While this will work on all of your private computers, it will not work on the ones in the University’s computer lab. To handle that as smooth as possible, you can use the functionality of the envimaR package which allows to set defaults for all computers but one special type which is handled differently.</p>

<h2 id="basic-workflow-of-the-setup-procedure">Basic workflow of the setup procedure</h2>

<p>There are two aspects we would draw your attention to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Define everything once not twice: It is a good idea to define your project
folder structure, the required libraries and other settings in one place. A simple
approach would be a setup script, i.e. something like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">000_setup.R</code> that is sourced
into each control or analysis script of your project.</li>
  <li>Use the same project folder structure in a team: Use the same folder structure
relative to a fixed starting point across all computers and devices of your team.
As a starting point, a folder in your home directory  (e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/edu</code>) is a good choice.
Within this folder you can directly store your projects or use a symlink to any
other place on your storage devices. 1</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="special-considerations-at-our-computer-labs">Special considerations at our computer labs</h3>
<p>The R home directory on the computers in the labs at Marburg University points to
the network drive <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">H:/Documents</code>. For storage space reasons, you could not use
this drive for symlinks. Therefore, you have to define an alternative starting point
for your project folders to work with.</p>

<p>To handle your project relative on all computers using something beneath your 
home directory <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~</code> as a starting point except on one type of computer (i.e. the
ones in the University computer labs), we recommend to use the functionality of
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">envimaR</code> package.</p>

<h3 id="preliminary-consideration">Preliminary consideration</h3>
<p>Again f the course we assume that</p>
<ul>
  <li>your local starting point is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/edu</code>,</li>
  <li>your project is called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mpg-envinsys-plygrnd</code>,</li>
  <li>your git repository is called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name_of_github_team_repository</code>,</li>
  <li>your setup script is called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">000_setup.R</code> and is located at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name_of_github_team_repository/src</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please install the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">envimaR</code> package from GitHub.</p>

<div class="language-r highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">devtools</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">install_github</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"envima/envimaR"</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w">

<h2 id="template-for-setup-script">Template for setup script</h2>

<p>First of all copy and paste the following code in a file named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">000_setup.R</code>. You may use it as a tempate for a basic setup script which is called in the beginning of each analysis script you start.</p>
