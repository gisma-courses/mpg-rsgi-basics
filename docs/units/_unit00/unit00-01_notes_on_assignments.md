Within this course you will submit your solutions for the course assignments to your GitHub-hosted learning log, i.e. your  personal classroom repository. Don't get confused about _"personal repository"_. Once you have a GitHub account, you can create as many repositories as you like at your account and invite any team members you want but for assignments within our courses, always use your classroom repository. 
<!--more-->
The classroom repository will be created automatically by following a link to the respective classroom assignment which will be provided by the instructors. Your team's classroom repository will be hosted as part of GeoMOER, our learning log space at GitHub for Marburg Open Educational Resources.

If not stated otherwise, the deadline for an assignment is the date and time of the next course session. The submissions generally encompass R or R markdown with compiled html files or presentations in PDF format.

To start with, get yourself a GitHub account if you have not one already and create your learning log using the link provided by the course lecturers. Be aware that once the learning log repository is created, you will stick to this until the end of the course.

## A note on assignments in education
Please remember that also this course uses assignments. Hence, our very strong suggestion is the following: First, try to solve each task at hand individually. Second, invite and involve colleagues and share your individual solutions. Help each other, leaf no one behind, discuss problems, pros and cons and rethink your solution which will be the one which is submitted and/or forms the basis for the next task in your problem solving workflow. In doing so you will get the maximum from this course because learning and training your skills is most effective in problem-based and peer-to-peer scenarios.


Please do not take any shortcuts here, just do it right and take as much from this course as you can.
