## Data set for training purposes

* [Course Data Server](http://gofile.me/3Z8AJ/omf5DvyhL){:target="_blank"} data from the course data server (for the required password please look at the [Ilias page](https://ilias.uni-marburg.de/ilias.php?ref_id=2160452&cmd=frameset&cmdClass=ilrepositorygui&cmdNode=wi&baseClass=ilrepositorygui) or contact the instructor]).

## Basic Software tools

Shell — any command line environment will do for most of the exercises. For Linux we recommend the [bash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_%28Unix_shell%29) shell. For Windows, although the Windows command line can be used, we strongly recommend the shell coming with the [OSGeo4W](http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w) installation. If you want a Linux flavored shell in Windows, you can also use the one that comes with the [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads) installation which you would need for Git anyway.

GIS — most commercial or open source GIS systems will be fine. Actually in the beginning we strongly recommend:

* [QGIS](HTTP://www.qgis.org/de/docs/user_manual/index.html#qgis-manual-index-reference) has become one of the most promising and most integrative open source GIS systems over the last years. Through the processing plugin, it additionally integrates modules from the other leading free GIS solutions like [GRASS](http://grass.osgeo.org/documentation/), [SAGA](http://www.saga-gis.org/en/about/references.html)
[Orfeo Toolbox](http://orfeo-toolbox.org/otb/) which is specifically designed for remote sensing operations.

Regarding installation, for Ubuntu Linux, the [Ubuntu GIS package](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuGIS) is a good choice. For Windows, we strongly recommend installing everything via the [OSGeo4W](http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/) environment and not the standalone QGIS installation tool. 

On the link2GI github site you will find a comprehensive [installation guide](https://r-spatial.github.io/link2GI/articles/link2GI6.html).

We will use the statistical scripting language [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and we highly recommend the  [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/) integrated developing environment. 

Please follow the instructions according to your operating system.
